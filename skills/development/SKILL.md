# Development Workflow

This skill describes how to interact with the project's build system (Vite).

## ⚡️ Common Commands

### Start Development Server
Run the local development server with hot module replacement (HMR).
```bash
npm run dev
```
*   **Port**: Usually `http://localhost:5173`
*   **Usage**: Use this for all active development.

### Build for Production
Compile the app into static files for deployment.
```bash
npm run build
```
*   **Output**: `dist/` directory.
*   **Artifacts**: HTML, CSS, and JS bundles (minified).

### Preview Production Build
Locally preview the production build to ensure everything works as expected before deploying.
```bash
npm run preview
```
*   **Prerequisite**: Must run `npm run build` first.

## 📦 Dependencies
To install new packages:
```bash
npm install <package-name>
```

To install dev dependencies:
```bash
npm install -D <package-name>
```
