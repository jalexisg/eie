## 🤖 Welcome, Agent
This project is optimized for collaboration between humans and AI agents.
It follows the [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md) standard to provide clear context, instructions, and skills.

## 📍 Project Overview
**El Inversor Eficiente (Redesign)** is a fast, lightweight educational website for finance courses.
It is built with **Vanilla JavaScript (Vite)** to ensure maximum performance and simplicity without the overhead of heavy frameworks.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Core**: Vanilla JS (ES Modules)
- **Styling**: Standard CSS (Modular imports)
- **Architecture**: Functional Components (Template Literals)

## 📂 Core Structure
- `src/main.js`: Entry point & Router.
- `src/components/`: Reusable UI components.
- `src/style.css`: Global styles.

## 🧠 Skills
This project exposes "Skills" to help agents perform common tasks correctly.
See the `skills/` directory for detailed instructions on:
- **Development**: How to build, run, and test.
- **Component Management**: How to create and register new UI components.

## 🚀 Guiding Principles
1.  **Keep it Simple**: No React, No Vue. Just JS.
2.  **Performance First**: The site must load instantly.
3.  **Clean Code**: Readable, modular functional components.
